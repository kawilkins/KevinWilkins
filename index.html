                        I work for an Internet Service Provider (ISP) providing end user support for data and voice services.  In my off time I enjoy coding and helping family and friends with tech issues.  Even outside of work I enjoy working with technology and consider it a hobby.  It is edifying and a privilege to be able to work in a field that is constantly growing.  There is always something new to learn!
                    </p>
                
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I have a few coding projects I am working on that can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kawilkins" class="hyperlink" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  These projects mainly include work in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and C++.
                    </p>
            
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        While the extent of my work is smaller than I would like I am proactive in challenging myself.  My current goals include developing a contact form for this website using PHP and JavaScript - two web development tools I am beginning to self learn in my spare time.  Until that is complete you may email me at <a href="mailto:kwilkinsrd@gmail.com" id="Email" class="email"></a>.

                        See something that is not working right or broke on the website?  Have a suggestion for something you would like to see?
