                        I am an MIS Administrator for an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
                        My primary day-to-day responsibilities include responding to and resolving end user trouble tickets and participating in the on-call rotation.
                        I also oversee configuring, imaging, and troubleshooting end user work stations.
                        Other projects and tasks are assigned to me as needed.
                    </p>

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        I have worked a project that migrated our company email and file share to Microsoft Exchange, OneDrive, and SharePoint.
                        As I have implemented solutions I have also introspected and made mental notes for improvement to further streamline processes.
                        Most recently I have been assigned to assist in our project of migrating our servers from an older system to a new VMware solution.

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Outside of working hours I enjoy exploring and discussing topics and questions related to science, technology, and philosophy.
                        I am very passionate about learning and desire to share what I know with those around me.
                        It is edifying and a privilege to be able to work in a field that is constantly discovering solutions to better our world.
                        Each project and trouble ticket is an opportunity for continued learning, resolution of an issue, and encountering a different perspective.
                        There is always something new to learn!

                        I have a few coding projects I am working on that can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kawilkins" class="hyperlink" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
                        These projects mainly include work in HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and C++.
                        While the extent of my work is smaller than I would like I am proactive in challenging myself.

                        My current goal for my website is developing a contact form which I am deciding to use Google Forms to design and embed.
